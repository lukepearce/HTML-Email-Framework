HTML Email Framework
====================
A (mostly) cross-client compliant HTML email framework.

_Documentation and improvements to come..._

__Basic Usage...__  
Use the template to build your email. Then, run it through a css inliner tool like [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to bring the styles inline. Then, embed the conetents of the `embedded-css.html` file in the head of the freshly inlined email and edit those styles if you please, being sure to remove all comments when you are done.

If you use Sublime Text 2, drop the included snippets into your `/Packages/User` folder in your Sublime Text 2 application files to start building HTML emails with ease. It's like Zen Coding for HTML email!
